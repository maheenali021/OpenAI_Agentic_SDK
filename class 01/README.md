🤖 Gemini AI Agent Example
This code demonstrates how to create a simple AI agent using Google's Gemini API through an OpenAI-compatible interface.

🛠️ Key Components

1. Environment Setup ⚙️
Uses dotenv to load API keys from a .env file 🔑

Requires GEMINI_API_KEYS to be set in your environment variables

2. API Configuration 🌐
Creates an AsyncOpenAI client configured for Gemini's API endpoint

Uses the gemini-2.0-flash model ⚡ (a fast, efficient model from Google)

3. Agent System 🤖
Creates an Agent with basic instructions to be helpful 🗣️

Uses a Runner to execute the agent synchronously 🏃‍♂️

Includes tracing configuration (disabled in this example)

📋 Requirements
Python 3.7+ environment 🐍

Install required packages:
pip install python-dotenv

💡 Notes
The code uses custom classes (Agent, Runner, etc.) from an external agents module 📦

The configuration mimics OpenAI's API structure to work with Gemini's API 🎭

For production use, consider adding error handling and async operations 🚀
